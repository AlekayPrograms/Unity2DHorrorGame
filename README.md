## Game Mechanics

### Puzzle Breakdown

1. **First Puzzle**:  
   - Objective: Move an obstacle onto a pressure plate to unlock the next room.
   - As soon as the puzzle is completed, the patient NPC begins hunting you. There’s no sound cue for their spawn—just pure tension.

2. **Second Puzzle**:  
   - Objective: A keypad puzzle in a room with 5 branches leading to different areas. The middle door, which is locked, requires a passcode. Find the numbers across the other rooms and input the correct code to proceed.

3. **Third Puzzle**:  
   - Objective: You enter a room with a heart rate monitor and a shelf. A blood pressure input is required to unlock the door. Follow the sound of a beeping heart rate monitor, interact with it, and adjust sliders on the door to match the blood pressure values.
   
4. **Fourth Puzzle**:  
   - Objective: A door with an exit sign awaits. However, you’ll need to have found the key hidden in various objects. If you fail to obtain it, you’ll have to search the map while being hunted by the patient.

### Additional Notes:
- **Interactive Objects**: Shelves scattered throughout the rooms may contain the key for the final exit door.
- **Patient Threat**: The patient NPC roams the hospital, increasing the tension. They do not provide audio cues, so you must rely on your senses and intuition to avoid them.

## Artistic Notes

### Character Art:
The player and enemy characters were designed to contrast strongly with the environment:
- **Player Character**: A conventional doctor dressed in a white lab coat and blue dress clothes, contrasting with the grim surroundings.
- **Enemy Character**: A grotesque and desaturated figure, inspired by cancerous tumors and barnacles. The design leaves much to the imagination, adding to the horror.

### Environmental Art:
- **Background Design**: The hospital environment is desaturated with grimy, unkempt walls to convey the sense of abandonment. The environments are deliberately dark to emphasize the contrast with the bright and saturated character models, increasing the feeling of dread.
